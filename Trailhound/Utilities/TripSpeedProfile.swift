///   above `drivingSpeedKmh`. Crawl / queue time (5–20 km/h) is still moving for cruise and
///   median, but it is not “the speed I drove most”; that band used to beat a spread-out
///   highway cluster and report 12 km/h on a 50 km/h trip.
/// - **Median:** speed that splits moving time in half — half the drive was slower, half faster.
///   On a city-then-highway trip this sits below the mode, which follows the tight highway cluster.
/// - **P90:** speed below which 90% of moving time was spent — “upper pace” without max spikes.
/// - **Stop:** every interval whose implied speed is below the moving threshold, including
///   multi-minute stands where the recorder wrote no points. GPS wander while parked is still
///   a stop; only merge-length gaps and physical teleports are ignored.
