/// readings:
///
/// 1. Reduces by averaging buckets rather than by picking every Nth reading. Striding a noisy
///    1 Hz GPS signal keeps lone spikes and throws away the neighbours that would have balanced
///    them, so the line looked far more jagged than the drive was.
/// 2. Draws a standstill as zero instead of as missing data. The recorder stores no points while
///    the car sits at a light, and because the chart's x axis is time that left a hole — a stop
///    read as "no recording" rather than "not moving".
/// 3. Never averages or smooths across a real recording gap, which would quietly erase the stop
///    sitting inside it.
