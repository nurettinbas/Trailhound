# Travel journal (Seyahat günlüğü)

> **Status:** Implemented (schema V19, additive)  
> **Placement:** Trips tab → cam segment **Trips | Travels** (TR: **Trip’ler | Seyahatler**). No fifth tab.

A travel journal groups completed trips under one date range so the map can show **every route in that group**. It is a route archive, not a photo diary, social map, or live broadcast.

---

## Two layers (do not mix)

| Layer | Purpose | UI |
|-------|---------|-----|
| **Trip** | One recorded drive | Existing list + `TripDetailView` |
| **Travel journal** | Named group of trips + multi-route map | Segment on Trips tab + `TravelJournalDetailView` |

Adding a trip to a journal does not change category, vehicle, fuel, or Stats rollups. Deleting a journal **nullifies** membership; it does not delete trips.

v1: a trip belongs to **at most one** journal (`Trip.journalID` optional). Moving it reassigns; it is not duplicated.

---

## Product

- User (or an accepted suggestion) creates a **Seyahat** with a title, start/end dates, optional note.
- The journal map draws every member route. Tapping a day-row or a polyline selects that trip (speed-colored); others stay muted brand strokes.
- From trip detail, **Add to travel** sits under the note field.
- Empty state: create the first journal, plus an optional suggestion chip. Nothing is auto-filed.

Out of v1: photos, journal share-poster, CKShare, live travel, clustering of GPS *points* (only route-level overview simplification at far zoom).

---

## Placement (no new tab)

[`AppTab`](../Trailhound/Utilities/TabSelection.swift) stays `trips | stats | pairing | settings`. Journals live inside the Trips tab.

```
TripListView
  recording card (unchanged)
  TripListFiltersBar
    [Trips | Travels]   ← glass segmented control, filter-bar language
    existing chips (date / category / vehicle / place) when Trips is selected
    journal search + date chips when Travels is selected
  Trip rows  XOR  TravelJournal rows
```

Stats: a **Travel** chip next to the favorite-place filter (same independent-per-tab rule). Place filter already forces the trip-fetch path because rollups have no place dimension; a journal filter does the same.

---

## Data (schema V19, additive)

Journals shipped as **V19** (additive). Live tip schema is **V20** ([`ModelContainerFactory.currentSchemaVersion`](../Trailhound/Utilities/ModelContainerFactory.swift)), which also adds smart-category fields. Journals add a model and optional fields only — no store reset, no property rename.

### `TravelJournal` (new)

| Field | Notes |
|-------|--------|
| `id: UUID` | Stable identity |
| `title: String` | User-editable; suggestion may seed it |
| `startedOn: Date` | Calendar day of earliest member (start-of-day) |
| `endedOn: Date` | Calendar day of latest member |
| `coverTripID: UUID?` | Mosaic hero; default = longest member by `distanceMeters` |
| `note: String?` | Optional journal note (separate from `Trip.note`) |
| `tripCount: Int` | Denormalized |
| `distanceMeters: Double` | Denormalized sum of member `distanceMeters` |
| `fuelCost: Double` | Denormalized sum of `dynamicFuelCost ?? estimatedFuelCost ?? 0` |
| `searchIndex: String?` | Lowercased title + note + date range (list search) |
| `trips: [Trip]` | Relationship, `deleteRule: .nullify`, inverse `\Trip.journal` |

List rows **must** read denormalized totals. Do not fault `trips` or `points` while scrolling.

### `Trip` additions

| Field | Notes |
|-------|--------|
| `journalID: UUID?` | Mirror of the relationship for `#Predicate` (same pattern as `vehicleID`) |
| `journal: TravelJournal?` | Optional; nullify on journal delete |

`TripDerivedMetrics` (or a sibling `TravelJournalTotals`) is the **only** writer of journal totals and `searchIndex`. Call it wherever membership or trip fuel/distance/dates change:

- Add / remove / move trip
- `TripRecordingService.stopRecording` (if the user added the new trip in the same session — normally journals only accept `endedAt != nil`)
- `TripMergeService.merge` — see Merge rules
- `TripDetailView` save (trim, fuel edit)
- Trip delete

Existing V18 trips open with `journalID == nil`. Backfill is not required.

Register `TravelJournal.self` in `ModelContainerFactory.liveSchema` and `TrailhoundSchemaV19`.

---

## Suggestion rules (pure, opt-in)

Silent auto-folder is forbidden. A chip **Önerilen seyahat** / **Suggested travel** appears above the journal list when `TravelJournalSuggester` returns a candidate the user has not dismissed.

**Away day:** using `startLatitude/Longitude` and `endLatitude/Longitude` only (never `sortedPoints`), a calendar day is *away from home* when **neither** endpoint sits inside any `SavedPlace` with `kind == .home` (`SavedPlace.contains`). Days that start or end at home are commute days and break a chain.

**Candidate:** a run of consecutive away days that is not already covered by an existing journal, and that meets **either**:

- ≥ **2 nights** (calendar days in the run ≥ 3, or first start → last end spans ≥ 2 midnights), or
- total `distanceMeters` of completed trips in the run ≥ **150 km** (`TravelJournalSuggester.minimumDistanceMeters`)

**No home place:** no suggestions (the rule is undefined). Do not invent “away” from work-only places.

**Accept:** creates a `TravelJournal`, assigns those completed trips, seeds `title` from the farthest `startPlaceName` / `endPlaceName` (else the date range). **Dismiss:** store a fingerprint (`startDay|endDay|tripIDs-hash`) in `AppSettings` / UserDefaults so the same run does not nag. Editing trips can produce a new fingerprint.

In-progress recordings (`endedAt == nil`) are ignored.

## Screen inventory

### Travels list

Glass cards (`GlassTokens.cardRadius`, `glassRow`):

- Title (headline)
- Date range (`DateFormatters` — same style as trip rows)
- Meta chip row: trip count · distance · `FuelCostCalculator.formatCost(fuelCost)` (hide ₺ when `fuelCost == 0`)
- Mosaic: up to **3** `TripMapSnapshotCache` thumbs (`coverTripID` first, then next-longest), same appearance as the trip list (`cachedImage(for:appearance:)`). Prefetch like `VehiclePhotoStore.prefetch`. Memory hit is scroll-safe; disk/decode stays off the main actor (existing cache contract).
- **No live MapKit** in the list.

Empty: `GlassEmptyState` — title **Create your first travel** / **İlk seyahati oluştur**, `systemImage: "map"`, plus the suggestion chip when one exists.

Create: glass sheet — title, optional note, trip picker (completed, `journalID == nil` or already in this draft). Dates derive from members on Save (draft + Save, same as `VehicleEditorDraft` — no SwiftData write per keystroke).

Search: 250 ms debounce on `searchIndex` (same as trip list). Do not reuse `TripListPage.listPredicate` for journals; that macro is already at the type-checker limit (place + search + category).

Paging: `TravelJournalPage` — `pageSize` 50, `pageLimit + 1` probe, sort `endedOn` descending. Footer load-more section, not last-row trigger ([`docs/PERFORMANCE.md`](PERFORMANCE.md) trip-list rule).

### Travel detail

Same skeleton as trip detail: full-screen MapKit + bottom glass panel. Do not resize the map with panel height; use `MapFitContext.detailOverlay`. Elevation stays **`.flat`**.

**Map**

- One polyline per member trip.
- Palette: brand-blue steps from `TrailhoundBrandColors` / `StatsChartTheme.distanceSliceColors` (stable by `trip.id`). No rainbow, no recording red.
- **Selected** trip: full speed-colored segments (`SpeedColoredSegmentBuilder.maxColorSegments` = 60) + white casing (same settled look as trip detail).
- **Others:** single brand stroke at **40%** opacity.
- Tap polyline or day-row to select. Selection does not push `TripDetailView` by itself.
- Fit: union bbox of all display pieces + `MapFitContext.detailOverlay`. Toolbar expand/collapse reuses `TrailhoundMotion.mapExpand` / `mapCollapse` and frozen glass during the transition.
- Reduce Motion: instant fit, no draw-on, no mosaic crossfade.

**Panel**

- Journal title + note (draft + Save)
- Totals: trips, km, ₺, date range
- Day sections (`TripDateGrouping` / start-of-day) → existing trip row chrome → `navigationDestination(for: Trip.self)` into `TripDetailView`
- Remove-from-journal (swipe) nullifies membership and refreshes totals

### Trip detail

Under the note field: **Add to travel** / **Seyahate ekle** (`glassRow`). Picker: existing journals + **New travel**. If already a member, show the journal name and **Move** / **Remove**.

In-progress trips: control hidden.

### Stats

Optional journal field on the Stats filter card. When set, `StatsSnapshotLoader` uses the trip-fetch path (not 92-day rollups — they have no journal dimension), same as favorite place. Goal ring stays unfiltered.

## Map performance

Multi-route is heavier than trip-detail reveal. Hard rules:

| Budget | Value | Why |
|--------|-------|-----|
| Per-trip display path | `RouteDisplayPath.maxDisplayPoints` (1500) via `TripRoutePathCache` | Unchanged contract |
| **Journal draw budget** | **≤ 4000 points total** on screen | Long weekends stay independent of library size |
| Speed-colored overlays | **Selected trip only**, ≤ 60 segments | 12 trips × 60 overlays would hitch |
| Unselected trips | 1 `MKPolyline` each | Constant overlay count ≈ trip count |
| Far zoom (20+ members) | Replace individuals with a **convex hull or bounding polyline** (pure geometry, not point clustering) | Overlay count stays bounded |
| First paint | Do not fault `sortedPoints` | Async `path(...)` memory → disk → build, same as trip detail |
| List mosaic | `TripMapSnapshotCache` only (appearance-aware) | No MapKit in `List` |

**Adaptive decimation:** if `sum(displayPointCount)` exceeds 4000, raise per-trip tolerance until the cap holds; always keep each path’s endpoints. Pure function `TravelJournalMapBudget.allocate(pointCounts:totalCap:)` — unit-test with 12 trips.

**Overlay churn:** swapping selection rebuilds **one** speed-colored set and restyles the previous trip to a muted stroke. Do not `removeOverlay`/`addOverlay` the whole journal. `TravelJournalMapLayer` should be `Equatable` and ignore panel height (copy `TripDetailMapLayer`).

**Reveal:** first open of a journal may draw unselected strokes in a short tick sequence (~12) as a *single* growing overlay group, not per-trip speed colors. Same-session reopen is instant (`TravelJournalRevealSession`). Reduce Motion skips ticks.

Privacy clip: each route uses the same privacy-radius clipping as trip detail / share (`TripShareRoutePrep` / list summary). Journal map is a display path, not a second copy of GPS on disk.

---

## List / Stats performance

- Journal rows never walk `trip.sortedPoints`. km / ₺ come from denormalized fields.
- Recalc totals on `onStoreSave` (existing hop-to-main-if-needed modifier), not in `body` or on scroll.
- Suggestion scan: `startLatitude` + `endLatitude` + `SavedPlace.contains`. Forbidden: `sortedPoints`, `RouteDisplayPath` inside the suggester.
- Travels segment does **not** add `journalID` to `TripListPage.listPredicate`. A second page type keeps the trip predicate from growing.
- Prefetch at most the mosaic’s 3 snapshot IDs per visible card; do not prewarm every member path from the list (that was the trip-row GPS fault).

---

## Theme / motion / a11y

- Shell: `AtmosphericBackground` + `GlassSurface` / `glassRow` / `glassChip`.
- Accent: `TrailhoundBrandColors` blues. Recording red/orange only on the live recording card, never on journal chrome.
- Typography: system styles (`.headline` title, `.caption` meta). No custom fonts.
- Motion: `TrailhoundMotion.gentle` for list insert; `sheetRise` for create sheet; `mapExpand` / `mapCollapse` on detail. Reduce Motion: `nil` animations, instant map fit, static mosaic.
- VoiceOver: card label is title, dates, trip count, distance, cost. Mosaic images are decorative (`accessibilityHidden`).
- Appearance: follow `AppSettings.appearanceMode`; map style picker on expanded journal map matches trip detail (light/dark override).

---

## Merge, delete, recording

| Event | Journal behavior |
|-------|------------------|
| Merge trips in the **same** journal | Survivor keeps `journalID`; totals refresh; deleted IDs drop from mosaic/cover |
| Merge trips from **different** journals (or mixed nil) | Survivor `journalID = nil`; both journals recalc. User re-adds if they want. Do not silently steal membership. |
| Delete trip | Nullify; recalc; if `tripCount == 0`, keep the empty journal (user deletes it) unless they confirm delete-journal |
| Delete journal | `deleteRule: .nullify` on trips |
| Recording | Cannot join until `endedAt != nil` |

---

## Localization

Primary EN + TR in `Localizable.xcstrings`. Suggested keys:

| Key | EN | TR |
|-----|----|----|
| `trips.segment.trips` | Trips | Trip’ler |
| `trips.segment.travels` | Travels | Seyahatler |
| `journal.empty.title` | Create your first travel | İlk seyahati oluştur |
| `journal.empty.message` | Group trips under one map when you go away. | Uzaktayken trip’leri tek haritada toplayın. |
| `journal.suggest.chip` | Suggested travel | Önerilen seyahat |
| `journal.add` | Add to travel | Seyahate ekle |
| `journal.new` | New travel | Yeni seyahat |
| `journal.remove` | Remove from travel | Seyahatten çıkar |
| `journal.stats.filter` | Travel | Seyahat |

Language follows the system (no in-app language override). Currency still uses `FuelCostCalculator` / `AppSettings` (default ₺).

Share v1: keep per-trip share cards. A multi-snapshot travel poster is explicitly later (expensive, blocks UI if naively composed).

---

## Implementation map (when building)

| Area | Likely files |
|------|----------------|
| Model | `Trailhound/Models/TravelJournal.swift`; `Trip.journalID` / `journal`; schema V19 |
| Totals | `TravelJournalTotals` next to `TripDerivedMetrics` |
| Suggest | `Utilities/TravelJournalSuggester.swift` (pure) |
| Map budget | `Utilities/TravelJournalMapBudget.swift` (pure) |
| Paging | `ViewModels/TravelJournalPage.swift` |
| List | `Views/TravelJournalListView.swift` + segment in `TripListFiltersBar` / `TripListView` |
| Detail | `Views/TravelJournalDetailView.swift`, `TravelJournalMapLayer.swift`, `TravelJournalEditPanel.swift` |
| Stats | `StatsSnapshotLoader` request + chip |
| Trip detail | `TripDetailEditPanel` add/move row |
| Tests | `TravelJournalSuggesterTests`, `TravelJournalMapBudgetTests`, membership uniqueness, Stats filter, schema V19 open |

Do not put `@Query` for all journals if the library can grow; page like trips.

---

## Tests

- **Budget:** 12 trips with 1500 display points each allocate ≤ 4000; endpoints preserved.
- **Suggest:** weekday home → work → home does **not** produce a candidate. A Fri–Mon away block with ≥2 nights does. No home place → no candidate.
- **Uniqueness:** assigning trip T to journal B clears journal A; `journalID` matches the relationship.
- **Predicate isolation:** Travels segment does not change `TripListPage` type-checker load (compile + existing list tests still pass).
- **Totals:** fuel uses `dynamicFuelCost ?? estimatedFuelCost ?? 0`; GPS not touched.
- **Merge:** same-journal merge keeps membership; mixed journals clear it.
- **UITest (smoke):** segment → empty state copy visible (EN/TR).

---

## Privacy

Journals are local SwiftData. No network. Privacy-zone clipping on the journal map matches trip detail (display names / clipped paths). If iCloud sync ships later, `TravelJournal` + `journalID` ride the same opt-in store — this plan does not enable CloudKit.

---

## Out of scope (v1)

- Photo / media diary
- Social or public travel map
- Real-time travel broadcast
- A trip in two journals at once
- Fifth tab
- Journal share poster / multi-`MKMapSnapshotter` compose
- CKShare across Apple IDs
- GPS point clustering; realistic MapKit elevation
