# Fuel estimation

Trailhound shows two fuel figures. Neither is a pump reading.

| Label | Stored field | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| **Avg fuel** | `Trip.estimatedFuelCost` | Catalog cost: `distance × C₀ / 100 × unit price` |
| **Est. fuel** | `Trip.dynamicFuelCost` plus volume / rate / breakdown | The same `C₀`, plus GPS litres for this trip’s speeds, waiting, acceleration, and likely cold start |

`C₀` is the vehicle (or trip-snapshot) consumption in L/100 km or kWh/100 km — the Settings average for **this car**, not a fleet 7.5. Unit price is per litre or per kWh. If `C₀` is missing, Avg and Est. stay empty; the engine does not invent a default.

## What GPS can and cannot do

The app does **not** have vehicle mass, drag area, engine displacement, road grade, cabin HVAC, or a sure engine-on signal. Estimated fuel does **not** claim pump accuracy on day one.

It uses:

1. **Catalog baseline** — `km × C₀ / 100`. This sets the scale for the car.
2. **Additive GPS litres** — speed-shape delta + idle + transient energy + cold-start bolus, each scaled to `C₀`.
3. **Optional measured L/100** — if you change L/100 on a trip and save, that trip is a measurement. It does not replace the vehicle average. Enough measurements learn a bounded per-vehicle bias.

A map **Stop** pin is **not** engine-off. Auto-detected parking sits on the same GPS hole as a traffic queue.

## Additive litres (model v6)

Canonical copy lives on `TripFuelEstimate` in `Trailhound/Utilities/TripFuelEstimate.swift`. Keep that comment, this file, and the README formula in step.

```text
Avg            = km × C₀ / 100
baseLitres     = Avg
speedDelta     = km × C₀/100 × (distanceWeightedSpeedFactor − 1)   // signed
idleLitres     = estimatedIdleSeconds / 3600 × idleLph(C₀)
transientDelta = baseLitres × clamp(kTransient × energyIndex, 0, 0.35)
coldLitres     = coldProbability × maxCold(C₀) × warmupProgress

Est litres = base
           + motionConfidence × (speedDelta + idle + transient)
           + thermalConfidence × cold
           [× vehicle bias when ≥5 accepted measurements]

L/100 = 100 × Est litres / km
cost  = Est litres × unit price
```

Traffic score is a **label**, not a multiplier. Stop-go **count** is not a fuel term.

There is no global 10 or 18 L/100 cap. Component limits: speed shape `[0.65, 1.70]`, transient `≤ 35%` of baseline. For `km ≥ 1` only, a corrupt-GPS guard clips `0.5–3.5×C₀`. Below `0.2 km`, volume is kept and L/100 shows as "—".

Unusable GPS (sparse, teleports, distance mismatch) shrinks `motionConfidence` toward 0, so Est. falls back toward catalog plus a cautious cold start.

### Speed curve (1.0 = this car’s C₀)

Petrol knots (L/100 relative to C₀): 10 km/h 1.55 · 30 1.18 · 50 **1.00** · 70 0.90 · 85 0.85 · 100 1.00 · 120 1.25 · 140 1.55.

Diesel damps the low-speed bump; hybrid damps low speed more and high speed slightly; EV uses `0.50 + 0.50×(v/80)²` with no combustion idle or cold start (output is kWh).

The speed term is on **stored** kilometres. Unobserved distance stays at C₀.

### Idle, transient, cold

- Petrol idle `clamp(0.114×C₀, 0.08–0.20×C₀)` L/h. Diesel 0.75×, hybrid 0.10×, EV 0. Engine-on probability 0.85 / 0.65 / 0.20 for short / medium / long GPS stops.
- Transient is one integral of filtered positive kinetic energy (not a per-event penalty). Hybrid/EV regen is capped at 35% / 55% of traction energy.
- Cold start uses the previous completed trip on the same vehicle (soak + how long/far that trip was). No previous trip → cold is likely, with lower confidence. Max petrol bolus is `1.4 × C₀ / 100` litres (~1.4 km of extra fuel).

### Efficiency and traffic

Efficiency (neutral 80) is from `rate / C₀`, not an absolute L/100. Traffic is Low / Moderate / Heavy / Unknown from GPS only — not live traffic, not a second fuel multiplier.

## Scenario bands (`rate / C₀`)

Warm mixed city + suburban should sit near **0.95–1.10×C₀** (your average on a normal trip). Short stop-go and cold starts sit above; steady 80–85 km/h highway sits **0.80–0.90×C₀**; 120 km/h **1.15–1.40×C₀**. The same GPS trace at C₀=5 and C₀=10 keeps `rate/C₀` and scales litres with C₀.

## Where it is written and read

Written (never touches `estimatedFuelCost` or GPS points):

- trip end, edit save, merge, cleanup, orphan finalize → `TripDerivedMetrics.recomputeFuel` (looks up the previous trip on the same vehicle)
- launch backfill → `TripDerivedBackfillService` (`trailhound.derived.dynamicFuelVersion`, currently **6**), in vehicle + `startedAt` order
- opening a completed trip also rewrites that trip’s stored Est. so the detail screen is not waiting on launch backfill
- changing a trip’s time / distance / vehicle, or deleting / merging it, recomputes the **next** completed trip on that car (`TripFuelDependencyService`) so soak stays correct

Read:

- Trip detail Est. fuel (`₺ · litre · L/100` or kWh), driving efficiency, traffic, up to four factor chips
- Stats totals, volume / rate / efficiency when the filter is a single fuel unit, daily Avg/Est. bars
- `TripDailyRollup` volume + breakdown (rebuild version **14**)
- CSV/JSON export `dynamicFuelCost`

**Not** used by month cost forecast, year recap, travel-journal totals, trip-list fuel chip, or widgets — those stay on avg fuel.

Mixed petrol and electric in the same Stats filter: cost still totals; litres and kWh are **not** added together.

If a fuel-formula refresh is interrupted, the version key is **not** written, so the next launch finishes fuel then rebuilds Stats.

Deleted vehicles: trip `fuelTypeSnapshot` + C₀ + price snapshots keep the original powertrain. An old EV trip does not fall back to petrol curves.

## Measurements and calibration

The trip-edit L/100 field is unchanged on screen. Changing it and saving marks **that trip** as measured (`measuredFuelConsumptionPer100`, `.userMeasured`). Catalog `fuelConsumptionPer100` stays the vehicle average snapshot.

`VehicleFuelCalibration` stores a robust bias (Huber / MAD outliers, WAPE, bounded 0.75–1.30). After 5 accepted samples the bias is applied; after 20 diverse samples, speed / idle / transient / cold weights may move inside 0.5–1.5. Logged pump expenses are not training labels.

## Schema / user data

Schema **V22** adds optional Trip measurement + estimate fields, rollup volume / `fuelUnitKey`, and `VehicleFuelCalibration`. Existing trips, GPS traces, and Avg fuel stay. Opening an existing store is a lightweight add of optional columns and a new table — the production path does **not** reset `Trailhound.store`.
