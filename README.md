# Trailhound

[![iOS Tests](https://github.com/nurettinbas/Trailhound/actions/workflows/ios-tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nurettinbas/Trailhound/actions/workflows/ios-tests.yml)

**Privacy-first trip recorder for iOS** — track drives with GPS, estimate fuel cost, and keep every mile on your device. No account, no cloud, no third-party SDKs.

Trailhound is a native SwiftUI app built with SwiftData. It records routes locally, works offline, and can start/stop automatically via **Shortcuts Personal Automations** (Bluetooth, CarPlay, or Wi‑Fi) — or manually from the app, widget, Live Activity, and Siri.

---

## Features

- **Cold-launch intro**: each fresh launch shows the icon’s road, hound, and corner stopwatch large on the theme color. The road matches the icon and its dashes move; the hound runs in place. The stopwatch’s crown is pressed, its hands sweep a little fast, and it rocks like a watch held in the hand. Everything then coasts to rest as the theme plate closes from the corners into the app icon, which lands with a soft haptic and fades out. About 1.7 seconds in all. Tap anywhere to skip. It does not replay when returning from the background, and it is skipped for Shortcut or widget starts, deep links, and VoiceOver. Reduce Motion shows a still mark. Settings → About → **Play launch intro** plays it again

### Recording
- Manual start/stop, pause/resume. **Start** (with the vehicle picker) sits on every tab and returns to the Trips recording card. It hides while a trip is already recording or paused. The notification bell stays while a trip is recording. Once the recording card scrolls off screen, the steering-wheel control stays in the Trips bar and returns to that card, including landscape when the card scrolls with the list. Rotating does not flash that control while the card is still at the top of the list
- **Shortcuts auto-start / auto-stop**: Create a named Shortcut per vehicle (*Start trip* + **Vehicle**), then a Personal Automation that **Run Shortcut**s it on Bluetooth / CarPlay / Wi‑Fi connect (automations often hide the Vehicle picker). The **Pairing** setup wizard remembers the trigger and vehicle, shows every Shortcuts step (including Run Shortcut), tests that Trailhound handles an external start, and includes a not-working checklist. Apple cannot let Trailhound create the automation for you. See [Shortcuts auto-record](docs/SHORTCUTS_AUTORECORD.md)
- Vehicle profiles with fuel/EV cost per trip
- **Avg fuel**: catalog cost from `distance × consumption × price`, shown as currency · litres (or kWh) like Estimated fuel. Trip detail **Avg fuel calculate** (with ?) edits consumption and unit price; the live line is **Avg fuel estimate**. Defaults from the vehicle and Settings
- **Estimated fuel**: starts from this vehicle’s average (`C₀`), then adds GPS litres for this trip. Short stop-go is usually above your average; a steady highway trip is usually below. Shown as currency · litres (or kWh) · L/100 on trip detail, with driving efficiency, traffic, and factor chips; Stats totals match after backfill. A Stop pin is not engine-off. Not a pump reading.

  ```
  Avg  = km × C₀ / 100

  Est litres = Avg
             + speedDelta      // km × C₀/100 × (distance-weighted speed factor − 1)
             + idle            // idle hours × idle L/h(C₀)
             + transient       // acceleration energy, ≤ 35% of Avg
             + cold start      // previous trip soak, scaled to C₀

  L/100 = 100 × Est litres / km
  cost  = Est litres × unit price
  ```

  Traffic is a label, not a multiplier. Same GPS trace at C₀=5 vs C₀=12 keeps `rate/C₀`. Engine: `TripFuelEstimate` (v6). Details: [Fuel estimation](docs/FUEL_ESTIMATION.md)
- **Vehicle avatar photos**: choose Library or Camera, then an in-app ~70% gallery/camera overlay and frame the crop before save (shown in recording / Live Activity)
- Siri Shortcuts: *Start trip*, *Pause trip*, *Resume trip*, *End trip*
- Widget + Live Activity controls
- Extra Home Screen widgets: **goal ring**, **last trip** (privacy-clipped thumbnail, optional), **monthly cost forecast**. Goal opens Stats; forecast opens Recap; last trip opens the trip. Recording Pause/Stop stay on the original control widget (and on the last-trip medium family while a session is active)
- **CarPlay Live Activity** (iOS 18+): while recording, the dashboard tile shows the vehicle icon plus duration, distance, and speed (same type size, shrink together when values get long; non-interactive; Lock Screen / Dynamic Island controls unchanged). The tile uses CarPlay’s native Liquid Glass like Maps / Now Playing — clear snapshot, no extra frost plate. Phone-call snapshot stacking is skipped while the in-call UI owns the dashboard
- Optional confirmation before widget/shortcut/deep-link recording start
- **Live follow map** (optional): Maps-style 3D/2D follow with the vehicle mark locked to screen center while following — the camera **and the blue trail** glide between GPS fixes (no 1 Hz hitch or chunky path updates) and **pull back as you speed up**; opening the map at speed keeps the curved vehicle→puck flight on the moving mark; a single blue traveled path fills in behind you at constant thickness in 2D and 3D; **Show entire route** pulls the camera back just enough to fit the traveled path into the clear map — above the recording card on a phone, beside it on a landscape cover and open Duo — north-up, on a short smooth zoom, while the vehicle photo and heading chevron still face the direction of travel; screen stays awake while open; start/pause pins on the map; pause/resume/stop stay available; while **paused**, the map cannot pan/zoom and 2D/3D / overview tools are locked so the vehicle stays put — Resume, Stop, and close still work; road animation pauses while the map is open

### Privacy & data
- All trips stored locally with **SwiftData** (file protection on store)
- Offline-first recording; geocoding retries when online
- Home/work saved places with privacy radius (route clipping)
- Optional Face ID app lock (device passcode required)
- Optional blur of coordinates on export
- Configurable auto-delete (Never, or 30/90/365 days)
- Export: JSON, CSV, GPX, KML
- **Report a problem** from Settings → About (optional): you can mail a sanitized diagnostic log to support. No analytics, no automatic upload, no Dev Log tab; on-device logs expire after 30 days. See [Privacy](docs/PRIVACY.md) and [Support](docs/SUPPORT.md)
- In-app **Privacy Policy** under Settings → About (same text as [docs/PRIVACY.md](docs/PRIVACY.md))

### Appearance
- Settings → **Appearance**: **System** (default, follows the iPhone), **Light**, or **Dark**, plus a **20-color shell palette** (Sky, Ocean, Teal, Mint, Forest, Lime, Gold, Sunset, Orange, Coral, Rose, Pink, Magenta, Purple, Violet, Indigo, Slate, Graphite, Sand, Ember). Default color is Sky. On the open book the section list is glass rows. When the Duo hinge is fully open that list is 45% of the content and the form is 55%. A partially open hinge keeps the seam on the fold
- **Liquid Glass** (iOS 26 native `glassEffect`, Material fallback on iOS 17/18): frosted cards over the selected hue so the atmosphere shows through. Light uses native glass with a mid-family tint — not a dark chrome plate or milky white card. The glass plate clips to the card; labels in the corners are not sliced. Reduce Transparency uses an opaque mid-family fill. Dark is a deep shade of the same color. The live recording card, follow path, and vehicle puck use the same hue; **Stop** stays solid red. The tab bar is the system iOS 26 Liquid Glass bar in Light and Dark, bottom and side. Unselected items stay the system ink. The selected tab uses that appearance’s palette tint. Map toolbars stay frozen circles so MapKit is not resampled
- The **Home Screen icon** follows the selected color (Sky keeps the Liquid Glass icon; other hues use a matching light/dark pair). iOS shows one confirmation when the icon changes. Home Screen light/dark still follows the iPhone, not the in-app Light/Dark picker. See [Design system](docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md) and [Appearance (wiki)](https://github.com/nurettinbas/Trailhound/wiki/Appearance)
- **Confirmation toasts** rise from the bottom, above the tab bar (or the bottom safe area on a sheet). Each one is a Liquid Glass card with a larger animated emblem and a haptic that matches the action: save, delete, merge, warning, Shortcuts automation, or a personal record. Reduce Motion keeps the fade and skips the icon motion

### Maps & analytics
- MapKit route polylines with speed-colored segments
- Trip detail: full-screen map with a fixed details card (scroll to edit; toolbar expands the map in place). Phone landscape rests that card on the bottom edge of the screen and frames the route in the map above it. After a turn, fold, or unfold, the route glides back to the center of the map that is still visible
- Trip summary cards pack left-to-right in a 3-column grid (no leftover empty slots mid-grid) and include **travel time** (moving minutes, excluding pauses) next to **duration**, **cruise speed** (average while moving — excludes stops), **most common** (mode of driving pace, not queue crawl) / **median** speeds, and **stop time** alongside average/max
- Trip stops (dwell detection), route thumbnails with vehicle photo/icon badge — list, travel-mosaic maps, and share cards follow Light/Dark and the selected palette. Switching Light/Dark keeps the last thumbnail visible until the matching map image is ready, so the trip list does not flash empty while scrolling
- Swift Charts stats, trends, monthly distance goals — including daily **cruise speed**, **most common** speed, **stop time**, **night driving** share, and dual **avg / estimated** fuel charts
- **Stats comparison** (same tab, no extra load on open): one glass-card language — 2-up goal + hero numbers, nested summary tiles with previous-period lines, polarity-aware arrows, a **Logged vehicle expenses** card (sums Pairing expenses, not trip GPS fuel; `?` explains the source) with cost/km, and swipeable chart pagers. An in-progress month compares against the same days last month. Place, journal, or category chips hide expense MoM and vehicle $/km (those filters have no expense dimension); the goal ring stays unfiltered. The Stats filter card uses titled selection fields (category, vehicle, place, travel) that keep long names on one line, plus **Clear All** to return to Last 7 days. Summary tiles show a packed skeleton while the filtered snapshot loads, so the grid does not leave empty holes. When the Duo hinge is fully open, the summary column is 45% of the content and the distribution charts are 55%. A partially open hinge keeps that seam on the fold
- **Recap tab** (Trips → Vehicles → Statistics → **Recap** → Settings; EN Recap / TR Yıllık): year awards, badges, frequent routes, month forecast, and the year recap story. Same glass cards as Stats. Unfiltered year / all vehicles — not the Stats chips. When the Duo hinge is fully open, the leading card column is 45% of the content and the trailing column is 55%. A partially open hinge keeps that seam on the fold
- **Year awards** first on Recap: unfiltered calendar-year medal grid (distance, night owl, goal months, busiest day, costliest vehicle / month). Recap is the story; awards are the grid
- Category filters, trip merge (select completed trips on the list; there is no split)
- **Share card** from trip detail — 9:16 JPEG (same canvas as recap / badge stories) with the trip-detail glass metric grid (3 columns, icon + title + value). Instagram Stories fills edge-to-edge; Instagram / Facebook get the image only; WhatsApp / Messages / Mail keep the caption. Privacy-clipped route snapshot, Light/Dark palette, matching app icon
- **Year recap** last on the Recap tab: compact poster hub (scene fills the glass plate, Get your Recap chip never truncates) opens a cinematic full-screen story. A horizontal chapter rail under the poster sits on the tab atmosphere and jumps into that story page. The first page is a title card (kicker + huge year + whisper on a vanishing-road bloom — no clipart). A purpose page names the year’s dominant category (built-in or custom) when there is a real winner, then lists every category’s share of the year’s km (percent + name + distance) — not a business-vs-personal table. A cost page shows estimated driving fuel and logged pump fuel as two separate glass cards under dual-hue pumps — never summed. Palette Canvas pages fill the cover with looping scenes, tap the left third of the screen (including the edge) to go back and the rest to go forward like Instagram (no Next), segment bars tuck under the Dynamic Island, Close and Share sit under them as Liquid Glass circles. Share exports the page you’re on (same scene and copy, 9:16 JPEG). Instagram / Facebook get the image only; WhatsApp / Messages / Mail keep that page’s title as the caption — not a leftover km poster or a bare Trailhound string. The badges page sits medals inside the glowing orbs (sparkles on the story), copy overlays the scene, Liquid Glass Share/Close. Badges unlocked that year show as the same 3D medals as the Recap gallery. The last page wraps the year (not a slogan); its segment fills like the others, then the story closes. Hold to pause. January plays the previous year; other months are year-to-date. Corridor counts are for that year only. Estimated driving fuel and logged pump fuel stay on separate lines. Replay any time. In January a 7-day full-screen invitation (Close or Get your Recap) replaces the old Dec/Jan autoplay; inbox / recap deep link still opens the story. A local notification + inbox row opens the story when last year’s recap has trips and you have not watched it yet
- **Badges**: cumulative km (100 silver, 1,000 gold, 10,000 teal platinum, 100,000 lavender diamond — each km medal runs a different motion on the S; the full km ladder stays in the gallery even while locked), plus business / streak / cities / night / corridor ladders and trips, hours, long haul, dawn, weekend, fleet, and countries — each family has its own color, icon, and idle. Recap compact card wraps every unlocked medal in centered rows and grows down (no sideways scroll); expand is a plain toolbar glyph on the card, then a circled collapse once expanded; the card grows into a glass gallery with 3D round medals (unlocked first); locked badges show formatted progress (km or counts) without spoiling the next non-km tier. Share on an unlocked medal is a compact palette-tint chip and exports a 9:16 JPEG story card (atmosphere, Trailhound mark, glass plate, 3D medal + copy). Instagram / Facebook get the image only; WhatsApp / Messages / Mail keep the badge caption — not a title string. Newly unlocked badges celebrate on Recap (3 s each, then the next) and also land in the notifications inbox with a local banner (tap opens the gallery)
- **Frequent-routes map** (Recap card expands as the MapKit map itself) — road polylines + heatmap; privacy-safe home/work labels; habit corridors in the same city as your top run)
- **Month cost forecast** on Recap: Recap-style poster hub (Canvas sparkline, title chip, amount on a bottom atmosphere gradient — no whitish veil) with driving fuel estimate + this month’s installments and other expenses (logged pump fuel is a separate line, never double-counted into the hero total); expand mix bar uses the shell tint for estimated fuel and rotated hues for installments / other; the hub card grows into a full-screen poster and frost breakdown like Badges (atmosphere + glass, not a grouped list)
- **Favorite place filter** on Trips and Stats (start or end matches a saved place); charts and summary follow the same filters independently per tab

### Vehicle care & costs
- **Reminders** — inspection, insurance, comprehensive cover, service due dates with staged local push + inbox (service: 30 days → 1 week → due day → one overdue; insurance: 1 week → due day → one overdue); **Add reminder** is the same row button, at the top of the section, above the rows. Mark done from the row (Done) to log cost and roll the next due date
- **Expenses** — **Add expense** is the same row button, at the top of the section, above the rows. Log fuel, traffic insurance, casco, service, inspection, repair, accessory, and other costs separately from reminders; split a purchase into **monthly installments** (up to 24) so each month’s share appears on Stats in that month
- **Receipt photo** on an expense — take a photo or pick one from the library, see a thumbnail in the form, and open it full screen with pinch and double-tap zoom. A receipt glyph marks expenses that have one; every slice of an installment plan shares the same receipt
- **Read Amount** from a receipt (optional) — Apple’s on-device text recognition (Vision) finds the total line (GENEL TOPLAM, ÖDENECEK, TOPLAM, TOTAL…, skipping ARA TOPLAM / KDV / change), outlines it on the photo, and lets you pick another amount it found. Nothing fills in until you tap **Use This Amount**, and the sheet warns that text recognition can make mistakes. Works offline; the photo and its text never leave the iPhone and no AI service is involved
- One vehicle detail screen under the **Pairing** tab: profile → reminders → expenses; cost charts live on **Stats**. Profile Save sits under the vehicle card, not in the nav bar. Phone landscape and closed Duo landscape stay one list, the same column as portrait, so the shortcuts card and saved vehicles use the width. On the open book and on iPad landscape, the focused vehicle’s photo or icon sits beside its name, with the fuel line under the name and “Default” above it only when that vehicle is the default. When the Duo hinge is fully open, the Vehicles list takes 60% of the content and that focus pane 40%. On that same pose, vehicle detail puts the profile at 40% and Tracking & reminders plus expenses at 60%. A partially open hinge keeps both seams on the fold. On the open book, the profile stays on the leading side and Tracking & reminders plus expenses scroll together on the trailing side. Add reminder and Add expense slide in from the trailing edge and fill that half; back and Save slide it back out. The Shortcuts card keeps the setup copy above the guide
- Overdue care also shown as an in-app banner; push fires once when overdue (no daily spam)

### Organization
- Personal / business categories (+ custom)
- **Smart category** (optional): suggests Personal or Business from frequent routes, Home/Work places, and weekday work hours; swipe the list row to accept — nothing is applied automatically
- **Travel journal** — phone portrait uses the Trips tab segment **Trips | Travels**. On the widest open book (Duo landscape) and on iPad landscape, both libraries sit side by side: Trips leading, Travels trailing. Turning that book upright fades Travels out, then the Trips list widens in place; turning back narrows the list, then fades Travels in. Phone landscape stays one list. Group completed drives under a Seyahat, all member routes on one map, optional suggestion chip, **Add to travel** on trip detail, Stats **Travel** filter. Deleting a journal unassigns trips; it does not delete them
- Vehicle management (petrol, diesel, LPG, hybrid, EV)
- In-app notifications inbox (trips, vehicle care, badge unlocks, January recap) opens as its own page from the bell on every tab. Choosing a row closes the inbox first, then opens the matching screen. A started or ended trip notification opens that trip on the Trips tab, read or unread. If the trip was deleted, the inbox stays open and says the trip could not be found. A trip never opens inside the inbox. The bell and the Trips merge or new-travel button stay in their own trailing capsule, side by side, whenever the tab bar is along the bottom, including the upright Duo, a normal phone, and iPad. When the Duo tab bar is a vertical column, they leave that row and stack in one vertical capsule on the same center as the tab, above the icons: bell on top, then merge or new travel. The landscape book stacks the bell, plus, and merge there. If that spot does not fit, they stay in the trailing capsule. On the split Trips | Travels book that capsule is the bell, plus, and merge together, so a rotation cannot leave an empty circle beside the side tab. Start stays in its own leading capsule. Rotating does not show a second copy
- Turkish & English UI (Localizable.xcstrings). Premium surfaces also ship Arabic, German, and Italian copy

## Platform support

| Platform | Minimum version | Status |
|----------|-----------------|--------|
| **iPhone (iOS)** | **17.0** | ✅ Portrait and landscape. Pairing stays one list in both |
| **iPhone Duo** | 17.0 | ✅ Closed and open: Badges, Frequent routes, and month-forecast close circles sit on the leading side so they clear the camera and status cluster. Open landscape: the Badges gallery is four columns, and Recap cards break on the fold rather than in equal halves, so the side tab does not pull the seam off the notch. Idle on the open landscape book: Trips on the leading half, Travels on the trailing half. Turning upright fades Travels, then widens Trips; turning back does that in reverse. Closed landscape stays one list and keeps the recording card in that list so it scrolls with the trips. Closed landscape Pairing stays that same list, so the shortcuts card and saved vehicles use the width. The default-vehicle pane is the open book. Open landscape centers the recording card vertically in the leading half and puts the trip list on the trailing half. The card stays as tall as its contents, so the road shadow sits above the timers and the card does not stretch to fill that pane. Open portrait: the recording card sits on the horizontal fold and the trip list stays below it. Upright trip detail matches the phone: the map fills the screen and the info sheet sits below it. With the fold vertical, detail cards fill the leading screen and the route map fills the trailing screen. Turning either way keeps the open trip on screen. That page has no sheet grabber. Statistics chart dates shrink to fit each half. The fold gutter stays empty |
| **iPadOS** | 17.0 | ✅ Landscape Trips shows Trips and Travels side by side. Lists, stats, and settings use the wide canvas. Maps use a side panel. Narrow Split View and portrait stay the phone layout |
| **Widget (Home / Lock)** | iOS 17.0+ | ✅ Home Screen & Lock Screen widgets |
| **Live Activity + CarPlay tile** | iOS 18.0+ | ✅ Lock Screen, Dynamic Island, CarPlay Dashboard (icon + duration, distance, speed) |
| **Siri / Shortcuts** | iOS 17.0+ | ✅ App Intents + Personal Automations |
| **macOS / visionOS / tvOS** | — | ❌ Not supported |

### Why iOS 17?

Trailhound uses **SwiftData**, **App Intents**, **Live Activities**, and modern **WidgetKit** APIs that require iOS 17. The project does not build for iOS 16 or earlier. The **CarPlay Dashboard Live Activity** layout (vehicle icon plus duration, distance, and speed) needs **iOS 18** (`activityFamily.small`); on iOS 17 the Home Screen widgets still work, but the Live Activity presentation targets iOS 18+.

### Device & permissions

| Requirement | Used for |
|-------------|----------|
| GPS (Always / When In Use) | Route recording and background trips |
| Notifications | Trip started/ended alerts; vehicle care due reminders; badge unlocks; January year recap |
| Face ID (optional) | App lock |
| Shortcuts (system) | Auto-start/stop Personal Automations |

**Physical iPhone recommended** for real-world testing (GPS, background recording, Shortcuts automations). Simulator is fine for UI and basic location simulation.

---

## Requirements (development)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Xcode** | 15.0+ (iOS 17 SDK); CI uses **Xcode 26.5** on `macos-26` |
| **Swift** | 5.0 (strict concurrency enabled) |
| **iOS deployment target** | 17.0 |
| **Dependencies** | None (Apple frameworks only) |
| **Bundle IDs** | `com.trailhound.app` · `com.trailhound.app.widget` |
| **App Group** | `group.com.trailhound.app` |

---

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nurettinbas/Trailhound.git
cd Trailhound
open Trailhound.xcodeproj
```

1. Select an **iPhone** simulator or device
2. Update **Signing & Capabilities** with your Team (bundle ID: `com.trailhound.app`)
3. Ensure App Group `group.com.trailhound.app` is enabled for app + widget targets
4. Press **⌘R** to run

### Simulator quick test

1. Tap **Start** in the app
2. **Features → Location → Freeway Drive**
3. Stop after 1–2 minutes

### Automated tests

Run the full unit + UI smoke suite locally:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/run_tests.sh scripts/ci_pick_simulator.sh
DESTINATION="$(./scripts/ci_pick_simulator.sh)" ./scripts/run_tests.sh
```

Unit tests only (faster):

```bash
INCLUDE_UI_TESTS=0 ./scripts/run_tests.sh
```

UI tests only:

```bash
ONLY_UI_TESTS=1 ./scripts/run_tests.sh
```

Override the simulator destination if needed:

```bash
DESTINATION='platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17,OS=26.5' ./scripts/run_tests.sh
```

CI runs the same script on every push and pull request to `main` via GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ios-tests.yml`).

### Siri Shortcuts & auto-recording

Requires **iOS 17+** and **Siri / Shortcuts** available. After first launch:

1. Open **Pairing** in Trailhound → follow **Auto-start with Shortcuts**
2. Or open **Shortcuts** → search **Trailhound** and add: **Start trip**, **Pause trip**, **Resume trip**, **End trip**
3. For hands-free start/stop: create a named Shortcut with **Start trip** + **Vehicle**, then a Personal Automation that uses **Run Shortcut** on Bluetooth / CarPlay / Wi‑Fi connect (and **End trip** on disconnect). Automations often hide the Vehicle picker if you add Start trip directly.

**Siri examples:** *“Start trip in Trailhound”*, *“Pause trip in Trailhound”* (Turkish phrases are also registered for TR Siri language)

> Siri language and system language can differ. Shortcuts list follows system language; voice phrases follow Siri language.
>
> In-app Bluetooth audio-route auto-start was removed. Auto-record now relies on Shortcuts Personal Automations (more reliable across iOS versions and CarPlay).
